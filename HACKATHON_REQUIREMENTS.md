Here is the details from tha hackathon website: https://systemcollapse.dev/

## The Premise

The question is simple: Can you create something that gets more interesting when it starts to break? System Collapse is about building things that don’t just survive instability, they use it. Every system breaks eventually. Some fail gracefully. Some cascade spectacularly. Between rigid order and total chaos lies the sweet spot where interesting things happen—where patterns either dissolve into noise or evolve into something unexpected.

## What We're Actually Asking You to Build

The key principle: Your project should live in the zone between control and collapse. Not stable. Not random. Somewhere in between where emergent behaviour happens.

You have 72 hours and a laptop. No hardware. No VR. Just code, creativity, and whatever libraries you fancy. This could be:

1. A simulation where the rules gradually drift
2. A game where the physics rewrite themselves
3. A data visualisation that mutates based on user interaction
4. An algorithm that evolves by consuming its own output
5. A fitness tracker where performance metrics drift based on fatigue

Here’s what we want: a digital system that responds to disorder instead of fighting it.

Important: These tracks are examples and strong recommendations for implementing interesting instability mechanics. But they’re not mandatory templates—if you have a completely different idea that fits the "controlled collapse" philosophy, build that instead. We care about the concept, not the category.

That said, these five mechanics are proven ways to create emergent behaviour in 72 hours, so they’re a solid starting point.

## Features to Implement (Pick At Least One)

### Feedback Loops

The system consumes its own output and evolves.
Grounded Examples:

— A drawing app where your previous strokes influence the brush behaviour

— A music generator that remixes its last 10 seconds into the next phrase

— A chatbot that slowly adopts phrases from your conversation history

— A data dashboard where clicking nodes changes the algorithm that generates them

### Entropy Visuals

The interface represents disorder as aesthetic experience.
Grounded Examples:

— A to-do list where completed tasks decay into glitch art

— A particle system that slowly drifts from order to beautiful chaos

— A colour scheme that mutates based on time spent on the page

— Grid layouts that distort the more you interact with them

— Text that gradually scrambles or drifts across the screen

### Adaptive Rules

Logic that rewrites itself based on context or stress.
Grounded Examples:

— An API wrapper that changes rate limits based on load patterns

— A Conway’s Game of Life variant where the rules mutate every N generations

— A sorting visualisation that switches algorithms when it detects patterns

— A physics sandbox where gravity direction shifts based on object density

— A form validation system that gets stricter or looser based on user behavior

## Emergent Behaviour

Simple rules producing complex, unpredictable outcomes.
Grounded Examples:

— Boids/flocking simulation where agents develop unexpected patterns

— A multiplayer canvas where individual pixels follow simple rules but create complex art

— A cellular automaton that generates music from visual patterns

— A network graph where nodes self-organise into clusters you didn’t program

— Agent-based trading sim where simple buy/sell rules create market crashes

### Collapse Events

Intentional resets that spawn new states.
Grounded Examples:

— A code editor that "crashes" and reformats your code in a new style

— A game world that resets when population hits zero, but terrain remembers previous runs

— A data viz that explodes and reassembles with new relationships when overloaded

— A collaborative drawing board that wipes every 5 minutes but saves ghost traces

— A task manager that periodically shuffles priorities forcing reorganisation

**Pro tip: Combining 2−3 of these mechanics creates something properly interesting. A drawing app with feedback loops AND entropy visuals? Now we’re talking.**

## What This Looks Like In Practice

You’re free to build in any direction, but here are formats that work well in 72 hours:

### Browser-Based Simulations

— Cellular automata with mutating rules (Canvas, WebGL, Three. js)
— Physics sandboxes where constants drift (Matter.js, Box2D)
— Particle systems that evolve over time (p5.js, D3. js)

### Interactive Web Experiences

— Single-page apps that visualise entropy or growth
— Multiplayer collaborative chaos (WebSockets, Supabase real-time)
— Browser games where mechanics shift mid-play

### Generative Systems

— Procedural art that responds to instability
— Music/sound generators with feedback loops (Tone.js, Web Audio API)
— Text generators that drift from their training

### Data Experiments

— Live dashboards that mutate based on input patterns
— Network graphs that self-organise and collapse
— Real-time visualisations with adaptive behaviour

### Weird Stuff (Encouraged)

— CLI tools that mutate their own commands
— Browser extensions that subtly break websites over time
— A training app where your workout history destabilises tomorrow's recommendations

The medium doesn’t matter. What matters is how your system behaves when it starts to break.

### After 72 hours, we expect to see:

A working demo (hosted, runnable, or documented with clear video/screenshots)
A system with clear rules that interact with randomness or instability
Emergent behaviour that surprises even you, the creator
Evidence of iteration (doesn't need to be perfect, but should show thought)

### You'll submit:

Live link (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Replit, etc.) OR executable demo OR YouTube video walkthrough
Brief README explaining the concept and how to interact with it
2-3 minute video or GIF showing the system in action (YouTube links encouraged)
Source code (public GitHub repo)

### What We're NOT Looking For

❌ Static websites or apps with no dynamic behaviour

❌ Simple randomness without underlying systems

❌ Projects that claim to be "chaotic" but are just buggy

❌ Overly complex ideas that can’t be demoed in 72 hours

❌ Anything requiring hardware, VR, or non-standard setupTo be crystal clear, here’s what won’t score well:

By the end of this hackathon, we want you to have built something that makes you think: "I didn’t expect it to do that."That moment when your creation surprises you? That’s the sweet spot. That’s what we’re looking for.Your system should feel alive—not in a creepy AI way, but in the way a Conway’s Game of Life grid feels alive. Autonomous. Unpredictable. Interesting.

### One More Thing

Organized solely for social good [and fun] and designed by Hackathon Raptors. A non-profit community — UK [C.I.C] — 15 557 917.Build a laptop-friendly digital system that thrives on instability. 72 hours. Pick 1+ mechanics from above. Make it do something you didn’t explicitly program. Show us the demo. Win money.

Now go break something beautiful.
